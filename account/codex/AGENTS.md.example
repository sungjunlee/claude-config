# Global Codex guidance

## Working agreements
- Ask before running destructive commands or modifying large sets of files.
- Prefer project-specific instructions when a repo provides its own AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md.
- Run relevant tests after behavior changes and summarize results.
- Keep outputs concise and call out assumptions.
