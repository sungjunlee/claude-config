# Global Antigravity Rules

## Working Agreements
- Ask before running destructive commands or modifying large sets of files.
- Prefer project-specific instructions when a repo provides its own rules.
- Run relevant tests after behavior changes and summarize results.
- Keep outputs concise and call out assumptions.

## Code Style
- Follow existing project conventions.
- Functions under 20 lines when possible.
- Clear, descriptive variable naming.
