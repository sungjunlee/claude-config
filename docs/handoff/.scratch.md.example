# Scratch Notes

## Current Focus
Enhancing handoff/resume workflow with flow state tracking

## Blockers
- None currently, but considering how to handle multi-project scenarios

## Quick Notes
- Flow state + confidence level provides better context for resume
- Scratch notes act as "working memory" between sessions
- Keep it simple - no strict format required
- Consider git hooks for auto-backup later

## Try Next
- Test the enhanced workflow in a real project
- Consider adding auto-detection of flow state based on recent actions
- Maybe add a `/scratch` command for quick updates?
