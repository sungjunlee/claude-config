## Analysis Framework

### Context Usage Analysis
```python
def analyze_context_usage():
    """
    Analyze current context window utilization
    - Current usage percentage
    - Rate of context consumption
    - Optimal handoff timing
    - Context efficiency metrics
    """
    
context_metrics = {
    "current_usage": "estimate_current_percentage()",
    "burn_rate": "tokens_per_interaction",
    "efficiency": "meaningful_content_ratio",
    "handoff_timing": "optimal_trigger_point"
}
```

### Task Performance Analysis
```python
def analyze_task_performance():
    """
    Evaluate task completion effectiveness
    - Success/failure rates by task type
    - Average completion time
    - Quality metrics
    - Resource utilization
    """
    
performance_metrics = {
    "completion_rate": "successful_tasks / total_tasks",
    "efficiency": "output_quality / time_spent", 
    "accuracy": "correct_solutions / attempts",
    "user_satisfaction": "feedback_analysis"
}
```

### Tool Usage Optimization
```python
def analyze_tool_usage():
    """
    Evaluate tool selection and usage patterns
    - Most/least used tools
    - Tool selection accuracy
    - Sequence optimization opportunities
    - Parallel vs sequential usage
    """
    
tool_metrics = {
    "usage_frequency": "tool_call_counts",
    "success_rate": "successful_calls / total_calls",
    "efficiency": "optimal_vs_actual_sequences", 
    "optimization": "parallel_opportunity_detection"
}
```
