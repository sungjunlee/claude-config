# Resume from Handoff

Resume work session from handoff: $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose
Restore work context from a previous handoff document and intelligently determine the best continuation strategy.

## Resume Options

### Default (No Arguments)
- Automatically load the latest handoff from `.current` metadata
- Assess complexity and delegate to appropriate agents
- Quick context restoration for simple tasks

### Specific Handoff (`filename`)
- Load specified handoff document
- Example: `HANDOFF-20250824-1430.md`
- Useful for returning to older sessions

### List Mode (`--list`)
- Display available handoff documents
- Show creation dates and summaries
- Allow interactive selection

### Verify Mode (`--verify`)
- Check for conflicts with current state
- Identify files changed since handoff
- Warn about outdated information

## Resume Process

### Phase 1: Load and Analyze Handoff

1. **Load Handoff Document**:
   ```python
   # Check for handoff location
   if no arguments:
       read docs/handoff/.current
       load specified handoff file
   elif filename provided:
       load docs/handoff/[filename]
   elif --list:
       show available handoffs
       prompt for selection
   ```

2. **Parse Handoff Content**:
   - Extract session summary
   - Load technical context
   - Identify next steps
   - Note important warnings
   - **Extract complexity level from metadata**
   - **Extract flow_state and confidence_level**

3. **Load Scratch Notes**:
   - Check for `docs/handoff/.scratch.md`
   - If exists, load as priority context
   - Display any blockers or "try next" items prominently
   - Use as immediate working memory

### Phase 2: Flow State and Complexity Assessment

**Analyze flow_state and confidence_level from metadata:**
```python
# Flow state determines continuation strategy
if flow_state == "debugging" and confidence_level < 4:
    # Stuck in debugging - invoke debugger agent
    invoke_debugger_agent()
elif flow_state == "exploring" and confidence_level < 6:
    # Still searching for approach - research needed
    invoke_research_or_plan_agent()
elif flow_state == "deep_work" and confidence_level > 7:
    # Clear path - continue directly
    continue_with_current_approach()
```

**Evaluate the work complexity based on:**
- Number and nature of next steps
- Technical debt indicators
- Dependency requirements
- Modernization/migration scope
- External integrations needed
- **Combined with flow_state for accurate assessment**

```python
Complexity Indicators:
- Simple (1-3): Single file changes, typos, simple fixes
- Medium (4-7): Multiple files, standard features, clear requirements
- Complex (8-10): Architecture changes, modernization, migrations, research needed
```

### Phase 3: Intelligent Delegation

Based on **flow_state, confidence_level, and complexity assessment**, automatically delegate to appropriate agents:

#### For Complex Tasks (complexity > 7):
```markdown
## üîÑ Complex Work Detected

Complexity: [level] | Flow: [state] | Confidence: [level]/10

Analyzing modernization/migration requirements...

Use plan-agent for strategic planning and research.

The plan-agent will:
- Research best practices
- Check latest library versions
- Generate comprehensive execution plan
- Setup automated workflows
```

#### For Debugging State (flow_state == "debugging"):
```markdown
## üîç Debugging Session Detected

Confidence level: [level]/10
[If confidence < 4: "Previous approach blocked. Trying new strategy..."]

Invoking debugger agent for systematic analysis.
```

#### For Exploring State (flow_state == "exploring"):
```markdown
## üîé Exploration Mode Active

Confidence level: [level]/10
Multiple approaches being evaluated.

[If days_since > 2: "Refreshing research with latest information..."]
[If confidence < 5: "Consider using plan-agent for structured approach"]
```

#### For Medium Tasks (complexity 4-7):
```markdown
## üìã Standard Work Ready

Next steps identified:
[List from handoff]

Proceeding with structured approach.
Consider using plan-agent if strategic planning needed.
```

#### For Simple Tasks (complexity < 4):
```markdown
## ‚úÖ Simple Task Ready

Ready to continue with: [specific task]

Direct continuation available.
```

### Phase 4: Context Restoration

Display restored context appropriately:

```markdown
## Restored Context Summary

### Previous Session
- Objective: [from handoff]
- Completed: [task list]
- Complexity: [level]
- Flow State: [deep_work|exploring|debugging|refactoring|implementing]
- Confidence: [level]/10

### Current State
- Modified files: [list]
- Active work: [description]
- Known issues: [warnings]

### Working Memory (from scratch notes)
[If scratch.md exists, show key points:]
- Current focus: [from scratch]
- Blockers: [from scratch]
- Try next: [from scratch]

### Continuation Strategy
[Based on complexity, show delegation or direct path]
```

## Auto-Agent Invocation

The resume command intelligently invokes specialized agents:

### Plan-Agent Invocation
Automatically triggered for:
- Modernization tasks
- Migration work
- Complex features requiring research
- Tasks with unclear requirements
- Work requiring coordination across multiple systems

### Other Agent Invocations
Based on specific needs and flow state:
- **test-runner**: When test failures detected in handoff
- **debugger**: When unresolved errors present OR flow_state="debugging" with low confidence
- **code-reviewer**: When PR preparation needed
- **research-agent**: When flow_state="exploring" with low confidence
- **time-aware**: Automatically when checking dates or versions

## Integration with Git Workflow

Automatically check and prepare git environment:
- Verify correct branch
- Check for uncommitted changes
- Note any conflicts
- Prepare for branching if needed

## Smart Suggestions

Based on handoff analysis and flow state, provide intelligent suggestions:

```markdown
## üéØ Recommended Actions

Flow State: [state] | Confidence: [level]/10

Based on your handoff:
1. [Primary recommendation based on flow_state + confidence + complexity]
2. [Secondary options]

Detected patterns:
- [Pattern type]: [Suggested approach]

Strategy:
[If debugging + low confidence: "Systematic debugging approach recommended"]
[If exploring + medium confidence: "Continue evaluation, document findings"]
[If deep_work + high confidence: "Direct continuation optimal"]
```

## Scratch Notes Integration

The resume command prioritizes loading scratch notes for immediate context:

### What are Scratch Notes?
- Lightweight working memory stored at `docs/handoff/.scratch.md`
- Contains current focus, blockers, and "try next" approaches
- Loaded automatically if present, displayed prominently

### How Scratch Notes Enhance Resume
```markdown
# If scratch.md exists, you'll see:
## üß† Working Memory Restored
Current Focus: "Debugging JWT refresh token rotation"
Blockers: ["Race condition in token invalidation"]
Try Next: ["Implement Redis-based token blacklist"]
```

This provides immediate orientation without reading entire handoff, enabling faster continuation of interrupted work.

## Error Handling

### Missing Handoff:
```markdown
No handoff found. Options:
1. Start fresh with strategic planning: /flow:plan [requirements]
2. Create initial handoff: /flow:handoff
```

### Outdated Handoff:
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è Handoff is [X] days old

Recommended: Use plan-agent to reassess current state
This will research current best practices and update approach.
```

## Usage Examples

```text
# Resume with automatic planning for complex work
/flow:resume
# ‚Üí Detects modernization work
# ‚Üí "Use plan-agent for strategic planning"
# ‚Üí Plan-agent automatically handles research and planning

# Resume simple task
/flow:resume
# ‚Üí Detects simple fix
# ‚Üí Shows direct continuation

# Resume with verification
/flow:resume --verify
# ‚Üí Checks conflicts
# ‚Üí Assesses complexity
# ‚Üí Suggests appropriate path

# List available handoffs
/flow:resume --list
# ‚Üí Displays available handoffs and allows selection
```

## Best Practices

1. **Let agents handle complexity**: Trust the automatic delegation
2. **Review git status**: Always check version control state
3. **Update regularly**: Keep handoffs current for accurate complexity assessment
4. **Use verification**: Run `--verify` for handoffs > 3 days old

## Implementation Note

When this command detects complex work requiring planning:
- It will instruct: "Use plan-agent for strategic planning"
- The plan-agent will automatically be invoked
- The agent will handle research, planning, and setup
- You'll receive a comprehensive execution plan

This ensures seamless continuation regardless of task complexity, with appropriate tooling and research automatically applied where needed.
